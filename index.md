## About Me

Hello, I am Vin Shin, an undergraduate freshman at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) studying electrical engineering, B.S. 

I am an avid electronics enthusiast, working with robotics, PCB design, and (hopefully) semiconductor design. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in focuses of semiconductors/photonics.

This is a page to show everything that I have done academically, professionally, and also introduce who I am as a person.

## Research Interests

- **Semiconductors & Photonics** transistors, metamaterials, silicon photonics, high speed/frequency
- **Robotics** computer vision, control systems, machine learning

## Updates

- **[Jun. 2024]** Seeking research opportunities in fields of photonics and semiconductors.
- **[May. 2024]** Committed to UC Santa Barbara for B.S. Electrical Engineering.
- **[Jan. 2024]** Ended internship at Arcadia Tractor Corporation after 1 year.

## Fun Stuff

**[06.23.24]**

It's my 18th birthday! Was it anything special? No. However, I'm going to take the opportunity/excuse to write here my wishes and hopes for the future. 

My entire life, I was dead-set on becoming an engineer. It didn't matter if I wanted to get into mechanical, chemical, civil, or some other subtype; I always wanted to make something. After what seems to be many years of character growth, an amount of sweat and tears poured, and hours of solder fumes inhaled, I finally get into a school for engineering. This is it. This is what I have been waiting for. 

However, I don’t intend on stopping what I have begun. Just because I have gotten into college, it doesn’t mean I can relax (although, I am currently enjoying my 3 months of school-less activities). I’ll truly relax when the time is right. At UCSB, I will remain committed to maintaining and improving my work ethic, take every career opportunity I get, and shift tides within research.

On another note, semiconductors and photonics have caught my eye recently. In the past 5 years, I have only focused on robotics because robots are cool, but I think S&P is cooler. I would love to do some research in this topic (quantum photonics, nanophotonics) and hopefully take some classes on this topic as it highly intrigues me!

On a second note, I think I’ll apply for a credit card.
